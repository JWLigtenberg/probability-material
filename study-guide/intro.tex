\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgb865fed}

This study guide contains three parts per chapter of BH.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first section contains simple questions and exercises related to the text per section of BH. They are meant to practice while you read BH. These questions are (often much) simpler than exam questions.
\item There is a part related to the obligatory exercises of BH to provide motivational comments, hints and solutions.
\item The third part contains challenges. These problems are (quite a bit) above exam level, hence optional. However, if you like to be  intellectually challenged, then you'll like these problems a lot.
\end{enumerate}

In general, when working on these exercises, try first hard to find the answer. Then \emph{write it down} on paper. And only after having written your answer on paper, meticulously compare your work against ours. Like this you' ll get a lot of feedback, and you'll see that it is quite hard to get the details right.
You should spend time thinking about the definition and notation we use, and understand any differences. Mind that good notation and good understanding strongly correlate.

The last chapter contains old exam questions.
