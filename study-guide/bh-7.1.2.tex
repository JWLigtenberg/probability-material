\section{Our exercises on Section BH.7.1.2}


\begin{exercise}
Let $X, Y$ be two discrete rvs with CDF $F_{X,Y}$.  Can we compute the PDF as $\partial_{x}\partial_{y} F_{X,Y}(x,y)$?
\begin{solution}
This claim is incorrect, because $X, Y$ are discrete, hence they have a PMF, not a PDF.

Mistake: Someone said that $\partial_{x}\partial_{y}$ is not correct notation; however, it is correct! It's a (much used) abbreviation of the much heaver $\partial^{2}/\partial x \partial y$. Next, the derivative of the PMF is not well-defined (at least, not within this course. If you object, ok, but then show that you passed a decent course on measure theory.)
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
We have the random vector $(X, Y) \in [0,1]^{2}$ (here $[0,1]^{2} = [0,1]\times [0,1]$) consisting of the rvs X and Y with the joint PDF $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 2 \1{x\leq y}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?
\item Compute $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
\begin{align}
f_{X}(x) &= \int_{0}^{1} f_{X,Y}(x,y) \d y = 2\int_{0}^{1} \1{x\leq y} \d y = 2\int_{x}^{1} \d y = 2(1-x) \\
f_{Y}(y) &= \int_{0}^{1} f_{X,Y}(x,y) \d x = 2\int_{0}^{1} \1{x\leq y} \d x = 2\int_{0}^{y} \d y = 2 y.
\end{align}
But $f_{X,Y}(x,y) \neq f_{X}(x)f_{Y}(y)$, hence $X,Y$ are dependent.

\begin{align}
F_{X,Y}(x,y)
&= \int_{0}^{x}\int_{0}^{y} f_{X,Y}(u,v) \d v \d u \\
&= 2\int_{0}^{x}\int_{0}^{y} \1{u\leq v} \d v \d u \\
&= 2\int_{0}^{x}\int \1{u\leq v} \1{0\leq v \leq y}\d v \d u \\
&= 2\int_{0}^{x}\int  \1{u\leq v \leq y}\d v \d u \\
&= 2\int_{0}^{x} [y-u]^{+} \d u,
\end{align}
because $u > y \implies \1{u\leq v \leq y} = 0$. Now, if $y>x$,
\begin{align}
  2\int_{0}^{x} [y-u]^{+} \d u &=
  2\int_{0}^{x} (y-u) \d u = 2 y x - x^{2},
\end{align}
while if $y\leq x$,
\begin{align}
  2\int_{0}^{x} [y-u]^{+} \d u &=
  2\int_{0}^{y} (y-u) \d u = 2 y^{2} - y^{2} = y^{2}
\end{align}

Make a drawing of the support of $f_{X,Y}$ to help to understand this better.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
We have two continuous rvs $X, Y$.
Suppose the joint CDF factors into the product of the marginals, i.e., $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x)F_Y(y)$. Can it still be possible in general that the joint PDF does not factor into a product of marginals PDFs of $X$ and $Y$, i.e., $f_{X,Y}(x,y) \neq f_X(x) f_Y(y)$?
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
\partial_{x}\partial_{y}F_{X,Y}(x,y)
=\partial_{x}\partial_{y}F_{X}(x) F_{Y}(y)
=\partial_{x}F_{X}(x) \partial_{y} F_{Y}(y) = f_{X}(x) f_{Y}(y).
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
BH define the conditional CDF given an event $A$ on page 416 as $F(y|A)$.
Use this definition to write $F_{X,Y}(x,y)/F_{X}(x)$ as a conditional CDF.
Is this equal to the conditional CDF of $X$ and $Y$?
\begin{solution}
\begin{align}
\frac{F_{X,Y}(x,y)}{F_{X}(x)} = \frac{\P{X\leq x, Y\leq y}}{\P{X\leq x}}
  = \P{Y\leq y, X\leq x|X\leq x} = \P{Y\leq y|X\leq x}.
\end{align}
It is a big mistake to write $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = \P{X=x, Y=y}$. If you wrote this, recheck the definitions of BH.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
We have two rvs $X$ and $Y$ on $\R^{+}$. It is given that $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x)F_Y(y)$ for $x,y \leq 1/3$. It is true that then  $X$ and $Y$ are necessarily independent.
\begin{solution}
For $X, Y$ to be independent, it is necessary that  $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x)F_Y(y)$ for all $x,y$, not just one particular choice. (This is an example that satisfying a necessary condition is not necessarily sufficient.)
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
I select a random guy from the street, his height $X\sim\Norm{1.8, 0.1}$, and I select a random woman from the street, her height is $Y\sim\Norm{1.7, 0.08}$.
I claim that since I selected the man and the woman independently, their heights are independent.
Briefly comment on this claim.


\begin{solution}
  Many answers are possible here, depending on extra assumptions you make.
  Here is one.
  Suppose, just by change, the fraction of taller guys in the street is a bit higher than the population fraction.
  Assuming that taller (shorter) people prefer taller (shorter) spouses, there must be a dependence between the height of the men and the women. This is because when selecting a man, I can also select his wife.

From this exercise you should memorize that \emph{independence is a property of the joint CDF, not of the rvs}.

Mistake:   $\P{Y}$ is wrong notation wrong because we can only compute the probability of an event, such as $\{Y\leq y\}$. But $Y$ itself is not an event. \end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
For any two rvs $X$ and $Y$ on $\R^{+}$ with marginals $F_{X}$ and $F_{Y}$, can  it hold that $\P{X\leq x, Y\leq y} = F_{X}(x) F_{Y}(y)$?
\begin{solution}
Only when $X, Y$ are independent.

Mistake:  independence of $X$ and $Y$ is not the same as the linear independence. Don't confuse these two types of dependene.
\end{solution}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Redo BH.7.1.24 with indicator functions and the  fundamental bridge (recall, $\P{A} = \E{\1{A}}$ for an event $A$).
(Indicators are often  easy to use, and prevent many mistakes, as is demonstrated with this example.)
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
\P{T_1 < T_2 } = \E{\1{T_1<T_2}} =
&= \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \1{t_1<t_2} f_{T_1, T_2}(t_1, t_2)\d t_{1} \d{t_2} \\
&= \int_0^\infty \int_{t_1}^{\infty}  \lambda_1 e^{-\lambda_1 t_1} \lambda_2 e^{-\lambda_2 t_2}  \d{t_2} \d{t_1}\\
&= \int_0^\infty   \lambda_1 e^{-\lambda_1 t_1} \lambda_2 \int_{t_1}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda_2 t_2}  \d{t_2} \d{t_1}\\
&= \int_0^\infty   \lambda_1 e^{-\lambda_1 t_1} e^{-\lambda_2 t_1}  \d{t_1}\\
&= \int_0^\infty   \lambda_1 e^{-\lambda_1 t_1 - \lambda_2t_{1}} \d{t_1}\\
&= \frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{1}+\lambda_2}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
