\subsubsection{Challenge: Improper integrals and the Cauchy distribution}

This problem challenges your integration skills and lets you think about the subtleties of integrating a function over an infinite domain.\footnote{Such integrals are called improper Riemann integrals.}

Assume that $X$ has the Cauchy distribution.
Recall that $\E{X}$ does not exist (hence, it is not automatic that the expectation of a some arbitrary rv.
exists).
\begin{exercise}
Why does $\E{\frac{|X|}{X^2+1}}$ exist? Find its value. It is essential that you include your arguments.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Explain why the previous exercise implies that $\E{\frac{X}{X^2+1}}$ exists. Then find its value.
\end{exercise}
