\subsection{Why is the Exponential Distribution so important?}

At the Paris metro, a train arrives every 3 minutes on a platform.
Suppose that 50 people arrive between the departure of a train and an arrival.
It seems entirely reasonable to me to model the arrival times of the individual people as distributed on the interval \([0,3]\).
What is the distribution of the inter-arrival times of these people? Amazingly, this turns out to be nearly exponential. To check this fact, we use simulation in this question.

You might want to compare your final result to Figure BH.13.1 (It is not forbidden to read the book beyond what you have to do for this course!).


\begin{minted}[]{python}
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(3)


num = 5 # small sample at first, for checking.
start, end = 0, 3
labda = num / (end - start)  # per minute
print(1 / labda)

A = np.sort(np.random.uniform(start, end, size=num))
print(A) #this
print(A[1:])
print(A[:-1])
X = A[1:] - A[:-1]
print(X)

print(X.mean(), X.std())
\end{minted}


\begin{minted}[]{R}
set.seed(3)


num = 5  # small sample at first, for checking.
start = 0
end = 3
labda = num / (end - start)  # per minute
print(1 / labda)

A = sort(runif(num, min = start, max = end))
print(A) #this
print(A[-1])
print(A[-length(A)])
X = A[-1] - A[-length(A)]
print(X)

print(mean(X))
print(sd(X))
\end{minted}

\begin{exercise}
Explain the result of line P.12 (R.11) marked as 'this'.\footnote{Line P.x refers to line x of the Python code.
  Line R.x refers to line x of the R code.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Compare the result of  line P.13 and P.14 (R.12, R.13);  explain what is \texttt{A[1:]} (\texttt{A[-1]}).\footnote{When two pieces of code are given and one is in parentheses, the first one is the Python code and the one in parentheses is the R code. So if you use Python you have to explain what  \texttt{A[1:]} does; if you use R you have to explain what \texttt{A[-1]} does.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Compare the result of  line P.12 and P.14 (R.11 and R.13);  explain what is \texttt{A[:-1]} (\texttt{A[-length(A)]}).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 Explain what is \texttt{X} in P.15 (R.14).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Why do we compare $1/\lambda$ and \texttt{X.mean()}?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Recall that $\E X = \sigma (X)$ when $X\sim \Exp{\lambda}$.
Hence, what do you expect to see for \texttt{X.std()}?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 Run the code for a larger sample, e.g. 50, and discuss (very briefly) your results.
\end{exercise}
