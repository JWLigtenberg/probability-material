\begin{solution}
    Yes. Consider what happens if we make X usually 0 but on rare occasions, X is extremely large (like the outcome of a lottery); Y , on the other hand, can be more moderate. For a simple example, let X be $10^6$ with probability 1/100 and 0 with probability 99/100, and let Y be the constant 1 (which is a degenerated r.v. taking one value with probability one).
