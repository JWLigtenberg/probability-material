\begin{exercise} [BH.2.7] 
A hat contains 100 coins, where at least 99 are fair, but there may be one that is double- headed (always landing Heads); if there is no such coin, then all 100 are fair. Let D be the event that there is such a coin, and suppose that P(D) = 1/2. A coin is chosen uniformly at random. The chosen coin is flipped 7 times, and it lands Heads all 7 times.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Given this information, what is the probability that one of the coins is double-headed?
		\item Given this information, what is the probability that the chosen coin is double-headed?
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{solution}
	 	Denote by $D$ the event that there is a double headed coin. 
	\begin{align*}
		P(D|H_{7})& = \frac{P(H_{7}|D)P(D)}{P(H_{7}|D)P(D) + P(H_{7}|D^{C})P(D^{C})}\\
		&=\frac{P(H_{7}|D)\frac{1}{2}}{P(H_{7}|D)\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}^8}.
	\end{align*}
	What remains is $P(H_{7}|D)$. Denote by $C$ the event that you select the double headed coin, then, using the law of total probability
	\begin{align*}
		P(H_{7}|D) &=P(H_{7}|D,C)P(C|D) + P(H_{7}|D,C^{C})P(C^{C}|D)\\
		& = \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{2}^7\frac{99}{100}.
	\end{align*}
	Plugging in the numbers into our expression for $P(D|H_{7})$, we find that
	\begin{align*}
		P(D|H_{7}) = \frac{227}{327} = 0.6942.\
	\end{align*}
\end{solution}
