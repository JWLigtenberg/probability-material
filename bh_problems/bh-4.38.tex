\begin{exercise} [BH.4.38] Each of $n \geq 2$ people puts their name on a slip of paper (no two have the same name). The slips of paper are shuffled in a hat, and then each person draws one (uniformly at random at each stage, without replacement). Find the average number of people who draw their own names.
%\begin{hint}
%\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
    Let $I_i=1$ denote the event that $i$ picks his/her own name.  For arbitrary individual $i$, the event that $i$ picks his/her own name ($\{I_i=1\}$) has probability $1/n$ (choose the correct one out of n) which implies that 
	$$\mathbb{E}I_i =1/n.$$
	By linearity,
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbb{E} \sum_{i=1}^n I_i =	\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}I_i =1. 
	\end{align*} 
\end{solution}
