\begin{exercise} [BH.4.24] Let $X \sim \text{Bin}(n,p)$ and $Y \sim \text{NBin}(r,p)$. Using a story about a sequence of Bernoulli trials, prove that $\P{X < r} = \P{Y > n - r}$.
%\begin{hint}
%\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
    Let's consider a sequence of Bernoulli trials: $\{X<r\}$ represents the event that in the first $n$ trials, number of successes is fewer than $r$, equivalently speaking, to have $r$ successes we need more than $n$ trials $\{Y>n-r\}$.
