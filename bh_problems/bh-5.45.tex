\begin{exercise}[BH.5.45] Emails arrive in an inbox according to a Poisson process with rate 20 emails per hour. Let $T$ be the time at which the 3rd email arrives, measured in hours after a certain fixed starting time. Find $\P{T > 0.1}$ without using calculus.
    \begin{hint}
        Apply the count-time duality.
    \end{hint}
\begin{solution}
    Notice $T>0.1$ means at most 2 arrives $N\leq 2$  within 0.1 hour:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbb{P}(T>0.1) = \mathbb{P}(N\leq 2) = e^{-2}\left(2^0/0!+2^1/1!+2^2/2! \right)=5e^{-2}
	\end{align*}
	(The arrival rate within 0.1 hour is 2).
\end{solution}
