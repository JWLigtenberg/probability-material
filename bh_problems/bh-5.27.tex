\begin{exercise}[BH.5.27] 
\begin{solution}
    The PDF of $Z$ is maximized at 0 , and gets smaller and smaller (monotonically) as one moves away from 0. So there is more area under the PDF curve from $-1$ to 1 then there is area under the curve for any other interval of length 2. More generally, there is more area under the PDF curve from $-c$ to $c$ then there is area under the curve for any other interval of length $2 c$, for any $c>0$. But there is less area for $(-c, c)$ than there is for $(-1,1)$ for $c<1$, so no such interval $(a, b)$ exists.
\end{solution}
