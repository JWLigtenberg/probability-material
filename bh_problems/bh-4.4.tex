\begin{hint}
    Backward thinking. 
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
    The expected value for one roll is $3.5$ (as calculated in the previous problem). So if given the choice between 1 rolls and 2 rolls, you should continue for a second roll if the first roll is 1,2, or 3, and stop rolling if the first roll is 4,5 , or 6 . It follows that the expected value of the roll-at-most-twice game is
    $$
    \frac{1}{2} \cdot\left(\frac{4+5+6}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3.5=4.25 .
    $$
    So for the roll-at-most-thrice game, the optimal strategy is to stop after the first roll if it's a 5 or a 6 , and otherwise reroll and follow the strategy described above for the roll-at-most-twice game.
    The expected winnings are then
    $$
    \frac{1}{3} \cdot\left(\frac{5+6}{2}\right)+\frac{2}{3} \cdot 4.25=\frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 .
    $$
