\begin{exercise}[BH.3.42]
  Let $X$ be a random day of the week, coded so that Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc. (so $X$ takes values 1, 2, ..., 7, with equal probabilities). Let $Y$ be the next day after $X$ (again represented as an integer between 1 and 7). Do $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution? What is $\P{X < Y}$?
\begin{solution}
	Yes, they have the same distribution (this is the example given in question Chapter 3 BH.39.). 
    \begin{align*}
    	P(X<Y) &= \sum_{x = 1}^{7}P(X<Y|X=x)P(X=x)\\
    	& = 6\cdot\frac{1}{7},
    \end{align*}
    Since for $X$ equal to Monday through Saturday, $Y$ will be larger, but for $X$ equal to Sunday, $Y$ will be smaller than $X$.
\end{solution}
