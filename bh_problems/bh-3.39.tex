\begin{exercise}[BH.3.39]
  Give an example of two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ on the same sample space such that $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution, with support $\{1,2, \ldots,10\}$, but the event $X = Y$ \emph{never} occurs. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, is it still possible to construct such an example?
\begin{solution}
    Let $Y$ be discrete uniform over the support and let $X=Y+1$ when $Y<10$ and $X=1$ if $Y=10$. Then $P(X=i) = P(Y=i-1) = \frac{1}{10} = P(Y=i)$. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then
    \begin{align*}
        P(X=Y) &= \sum_{y}P(X=Y|Y=y)P(Y=y) \tag*{(\text{LOTP})}\\
        &= \sum_{y}P(X=y)P(Y=y)>0,
    \end{align*}
    where the final inequality holds since $X$ and $Y$ have the same support.
\end{solution}
