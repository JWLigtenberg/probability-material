\begin{exercise} [BH.3.12]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Give an example of r.v.s $X$ and $Y$ such that $F_X(x) \leq F_Y(x)$ for all $x$, where the inequality is strict for some $x$. Here $F_X$ is the CDF of $X$ and $F_Y$ is the CDF of $Y$. For the example you gave, sketch the CDFs of both $X$ and $Y$ on the same axes. Then sketch their PMFs on a second set of axes.
		\item In Part (a), you found an example of two different CDFs where the first is less than or equal to the second everywhere. Is it possible to find two different PMFs where the first is less than or equal to the second everywhere? In other words, find discrete r.v.s $X$ and $Y$ such that $\P{X = x} \leq \P{Y = x}$ for all $x$, where the inequality is strict for some $x$, or show that it is impossible to find such r.v.s.
	\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Denote by $X$ the number of eyes of a fair die throw. Define $Y=X$ if $X\leq 2$ and $Y=2$ otherwise. 
		\item If the inequality is strict for some $x$, then we know that
		\begin{equation}
			\sum_{x}P(X=x)<\sum_{x}P(Y=y)
		\end{equation}
		However, summing over all outcomes should give 1 on the l.h.s. (left-hand side) and r.h.s. (right-hand side), so we have arrived at a contradiction. We conclude it is not possible to find discrete r.v.'s such that the stated inequality holds.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
